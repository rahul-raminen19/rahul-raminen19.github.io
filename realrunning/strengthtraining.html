        <p>Lifting is def the wave. If you're scared that you're going to gain too much muscle
        mass and lose your running fitness, I assure you that you won't as long as you do it safely and
            correctly. The running that you do
        will prevent your muscles from gaining too much mass.
        </p>
        <h2 class="musclehead">Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            Increases running economy, which is the efficiency at which you consume oxygen to utilize your muscles.
            </p>
        <p>
            Reduces injury risk(if done with right form)
            </p>
        <p>
            Stronger legs give you more power. More power = longer stride for same effort = faster running
            </p>
        <p>
            Also, it increases bone density.
            Dense bones = strong bones = no need to drink milk(nah jk that’s a whole other discussion do what you want there).

        <h2 class = "musclehead">When you should Strength Train</h2>
        <p>

     In terms of when you should strength train in a day, you should do it AFTER you run.
            Your form is essential to your running, and lifting before can obstruct your ability to run.
            However, it’s not the end of the world if you can’t do it after you run, just make sure you allow for about 6 hours of recovery, and don
            t do a speed workout.
            </p>
        <p>
            Ideally, you would run in the morning and lift in the evening, but lifting in the morning and running in the evening is fine.
            The latter option is NOT fine if you are performing a speed workout, prioritize all your energy towards that and then lift.
            If you don’t do this, your energy levels will dwindle before your workout, and you’ll just explode (run bad splits and be sad) and we don’t want that.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of your training plan as a whole, you would strength train after a hard speed session to avoid tiring your legs out during another time in your training plan,
            but let’s be honest there are not a lot of people who have time for this. I personally did a leg day once a week immediately after a long run/workout.
            A general rule of thumb is to wait at least 48 hours after leg day to do speed work of any kind. Following an upper body day, 16-24 hours is suitable.

        <h2 class = "musclehead">What to Target?</h2>
        <p> Three very important muscles for running in our legs are the Gluteus Medius(glutes), Quadriceps, and Soleus.
            By focusing on these, we can design a lifting regiment that caters to the needs of a distance runner.
            For sprinting (800 meters and less), I would recommend these with slight variations and additions. </p>
        <p>p.s. hip work is mad underrated, and I'll usually sprinkle hip exercises in</p>
        <h2 class = "musclehead">What to work for?</h2>
        <p>Power (low reps heavy weight)</p>
        <p>Explosivity (plyometrics)</p>
        <p>Strength (progressive overloading)</p>
