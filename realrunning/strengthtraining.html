        <p>Aight, lifting is the wave. If you're scared that you're going to gain too much muscle
        mass and lose your running fitness, I assure you that you won't. The running that you do
        will prevent your muscles from gaining too much mass.
        </p>
        <h2 class="musclehead">Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            Increases running economy, which is the efficiency at which you consume oxygen to utilize your muscles.
            </p>
        <p>
            Reduces injury risk(if done with right form)
            </p>
        <p>
            Stronger legs give you more power. More power = longer stride for same effort = faster running
            </p>
        <p>
            Also, it increases bone density.
            Dense bones = strong bones = no need to drink milk(nah jk thatâ€™s a whole other discussion do what you want there).
        </p>
